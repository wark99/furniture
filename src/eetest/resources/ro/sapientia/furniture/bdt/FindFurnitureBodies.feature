Feature: Check if the find all endpoints works
  As furniture tool user I want to be able to see all the furnitures

  Scenario: One element
    Given that we have the following furniture bodies:
      | width | heigth | depth |
      | 10    | 10     | 10    |
    When I invoke the furniture all endpoint
    Then I should get the heigth "10" for the position "0"
